# SSH Logging Web UI (Work In Progress)

An web UI which shows all detailed information about all the login attempts made on the ssh protocol. This is useful to keep track of all the brute-force attacks happening on an public server. 

SSH remains the main gateway protocol to be protected on any publically available unix system, and hence its the protocol which is most exposed to wide-spreed internet attacks.

Proposed features as of now:
- List of all the SSH login attemps along with their I.P Information
- Alerts when multiple failed requests are made from unknown I.P
- Keep log of all the succesful logins done via SSH

Feel free to share any more features to be added!
